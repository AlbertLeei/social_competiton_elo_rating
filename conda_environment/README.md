# Setting up the Conda Environment

## Installing with Windows, Linux, or Mac 
0. Open your terminal. We recommend Anaconda Prompt or Command Prompt for Windows and Terminal for Mac/Linux
1. Change to a directory where you want to save your Conda Environment
    - From any directory of this repository, we recommend doing `cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)` to get to the root directory.
2. Copy and paste the commands one line at a time from this file into your terminal(all the lines that don't have the `#` in front, which are comments): 
    - [./environment_install.sh](./environment_install.sh)
